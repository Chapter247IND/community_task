    title: "What about GitHub Copilot?",
    content: "I used Copilot for 8 months in 2024. It was great! (I even included it on my 2024 list.) But Cursor blows it out of the water. Copilot was the most accurate when I was writing generic/boilerplate code (e.g. API endpoints) or test cases with lots of repeated code blocks. Anything more complex (especially logic spanning multiple files and modules) and Copilot was unreliable. Cursor feels like an actual context-aware pair programmer with a decent understanding of the project I’m looking at.",
